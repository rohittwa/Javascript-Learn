    <p>Q1. What is Object Oriented Programming?</p>
    <span>
      Ans: Object Oriented Programming or OOP is a programming paradigm (style of writing code). It is an approach to problem solving where all computations are carried out using objects. An obect is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Objects are the basic unit of object-oriented programming. In OOP we treat every problem as objects and compare with real world and try to solve the problem. A simple example of an object will be a person. Logically, you would expect a person to have a name. This would be considered as property of the person. You could also expect a person to be able to do something, such as walking or driving, this would be considered a method of the person.

    <p>Q2. What is Encapsulation?</p>
    <span>
      Ans:In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
    </span>

    <p>Q3. What is Abstraction?</p>
    <span>
      Ans: Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
    </span>

    <p>Q4. What is Inheritance?</p>
    <span>
      Ans: In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.

    <p>Q5. What is Polymorphism?</p>
    <span>
      Ans: Polymorphism is the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs different things as per the object's class, which calls it. <br> With Polymorphism, a message is sent to multiple class objects, and every object responds appropriately according to the properties of the class. <br>
      Polymorphism is a word that came from two greek words, poly means many and morphos means forms. If a variable, object or method perform different behavior according to situation, it is called polymorphism. <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Duck typing : </b> In python we follow a principle - If 'it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it must be a duck' which means python doesn't care about which class of object it is, if it is an object and required behavior is present for that object then it will work. The type of object is distinguished only at runtime. This is called as duck typing.</li> <br>
        <li>Operator overloading</li> <br>
        <li>Method overloading</li> <br>
        <li>Method overriding</li> <br>
