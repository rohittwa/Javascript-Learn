            In JavaScript, Classes define blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and methods. They offer a more structured approach to object-oriented programming.

            Classes are similar to functions. Here, a class keyword is used instead of a function keyword. Unlike functions classes in JavaScript are not hoisted. The constructor method is used to initialize. The class name is user-defined.
