		<h1>Events</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>
			HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. <br>
			When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2>HTML Events</h2>
		<p>
			An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are some examples of HTML events:
			<ul>
				<li>An HTML web page has finished loading</li>
				<li>An HTML input field was changed</li>
				<li>An HTML button was clicked</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.<br>
			JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.<br>
			HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.<br><br>
			
			We can use Events with DOM by two methods :-<br>
			1. document.getElementById("div1").event_name = function_name;<br>
			2. document.getElementById("div2").addEventListener("event_name", function_name, useCapture);<br>
			The event_name must be used without the word 'on'. The useCapture value can be true or false.
			
			To remove an event from an element:-<br>
			document.getElementById("div2").removeEventListener("event_name", function_name, useCapture);<br>
			The arguments in removeEventListener() method must be the same as in addEventListener() method.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a &lt;button&gt; element:<br>
			<div>
				&lt;button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()"&gt;The time is?&lt;/button&gt;
			</div>
		</p>
