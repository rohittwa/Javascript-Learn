		<hr>
		
		<p>
			The sessionStorage is a read only property of window object. It stores data in a web browser specifically to the domain and protocol for a particular session. It doesn't get sent to the server. Data stored in sessionStorage get cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts for as long as the browser is open and survives over page reloads and restores.
		</p>
		
		Methods:
		<ul>
			<li> setItem(key, value) : It allows to add a key/value pair to the storage object. If the key already exists, the name value will overwrite the old value. </li>
			
			<li> getItem(key) : It returns the value of the item that is set with the given key.  </li>
			
			<li> key(n) : It returns the key of the item in the storage object at the nth index which can be useful for looping. </li>
			
			<li> removeItem(key) : It removes the item in the storage object with the given key. </li>
			
			<li> clear() : It removes all the rows from the localStorage. </li>
		</ul>
