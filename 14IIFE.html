        <h1>IIFE</h1>
        
        <p> 
            IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined. <br>
        
            It is a design pattern which is also known as Self-Executing Anonymous function with lixical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator(). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.<br>
            
            The second part is creating the immediately executing function expression(), through which the javascript engine will directly interpret the function.<br>
            
            Ex:-<br>
            (function() {document.write('Geekyshows');})();
            (function(a, b) {document.write(a + "" + b);})(10, 20);
        </p>
        
        <script>
            (function(){document.write('My name is Rohit');})();    // The parentheses in which the function is enclosed is called grouping operator.
        </script>
