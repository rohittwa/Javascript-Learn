        <h1>Objects</h1>
        
        <p>
            An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key)
            and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.<br>
            
            Ex:-<br>
        </p>
<pre>
var fees = {
  Rahul:100,    <!-- Properties -->
  Sam:200,
  Rohan:300,
  total:function(){return (100+200+300);}   <!-- Method -->
};
</pre>
