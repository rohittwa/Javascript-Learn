		<h1> Strict Mode </h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>
			"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in strict mode. <br>
			The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5. <br>
			It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript. <br>
			With strict mode, you can not, use undeclared variables. <br>
			All modern browsers support "use strict" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower.
		</p>
		
		<script>
			"use strict";
			try{
				for(i=1; i<=5; i++){
					document.write("i = " + i + "<br>");
				}
			}
			catch(e){
				document.write(e.message);
